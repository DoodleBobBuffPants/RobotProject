Exercise 4:
	Topic - Topics are buses, communication mediums, over which nodes exchange messages, unaware of which node receives.
	Node - A node is a process that performs computation. They are connected as graphs.
	Master - Master provides naming and registration services to other nodes, enabling them to locate one another.

Exercise 5:
	Running 'roscore' starts a new master and core service. Executing this twice fails as it detects another master.

Exercise 6:
	The command 'rostopic pub' publishes a message of a specified type to a topic. Echoing this topic then produces the
	string at the set frequency. Executing type returns the type of the topic, useful when this is unknown and we have
	data we are interested in.

Exercise 7:
	The 'hello_world' program publishes a twist message on the topic 'cmd_vel'. It also sets the node to 'hello_word'
	and does this until ros is shut down. The launch file describes the session in XML, including the nodes in the launch
	with information such as package and type. The command 'roslaunch' uses the python program to launch with the nodes
	it creates. The state of the linear and angular velocity is published to the topic as expected. The Gazebo simulation
	shows a robot moving in a circle, which makes sense given the velocity message that sets linear and angular velocity
	to constant values. The right pane in rviz is a visualisation of the simulation grid, showing object outlines as seen
	by the robot which are added by the laser display, as well as the robot as a model.
